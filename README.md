## Installation

It is highly recommended that you use the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) package manager to install all the requirements. You can either install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or the (larger) [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution. It is also recommended that you install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) so that you can clone this GitHub reposiotry to your computer. 

Once conda and git are installed, the following commands will create a virtual Python environment named **pygeo** and install all the required packages:

```
git clone https://github.com/giswqs/python-geospatial.git
cd python-geospatial/binder/
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate pygeo
ipython kernel install --user --name="pygeo"
```
